## Project Overview

This project consists of a React frontend located in the `/frontend` directory and a Node.js server located in the `/backend` directory. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the backend server via RESTful APIs. This README provides instructions on how to set up, run, and manage both parts of the application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bhoomaahamso/oolib-dynamic-form.git
cd oolib-dynamic-form
```


## Setting Up the Frontend (React)

### Navigate to the Frontend Directory

```sh
cd frontend
```

### Install Dependencies
